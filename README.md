# GradSchoolAcceptance
For this project, I created a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).
TensorFlow with Keras is used to create a regression model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted. You hope this will give you further insight into the graduate admissions world and improve your test prep strategy.
